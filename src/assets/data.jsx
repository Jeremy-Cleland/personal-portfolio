    description:
      "My name is Jeremy Cleland, and I'm a software developer based in Michigan. I retired from the Army in August 2022 as a Special Forces Medical Sergeant. While the work I did while serving as a Green Beret was specific to our goals and missions, I learned and developed effective leadership skills and the importance of integrity, self-awareness, confidence, humility, and accountability. What excites me the most about software development is the constant innovation and growth, which offer tremendous opportunities to gain knowledge and implement those skills and expertise to provide the best possible product to all stakeholders. I am committed to joining a team and utilizing my experience to develop creative, market-competitive software to benefit the organization.",
